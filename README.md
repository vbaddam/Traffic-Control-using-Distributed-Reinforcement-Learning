Traffic-Control-using-Distributed-Reinforcement-Learning

Traffic congestion has been one of the major problems in urbanisation. The method to control traffic light signals hasbeen outdated which is making drivers sit idle at intersec-tions endlessly. To deal with this problem we need to im-plement the method intelligently. Many heuristics and Deeplearning models have been applied to this problem. Thoughthere has been an improvement over the traditional models, these models fail to work when deployed in a real-worldscenario. Then researchers started to explore reinforcementlearning methods and showed promising results. Still, themodels havenâ€™t properly established a communication chan-nel between the intersection to achieve the global optimum.In this paper, we set out to create a parameter sharing optionbetween intersections and thus enabling communication be-tween the junctions. This method showed promising resultsand overcame the baseline reinforcement, learning models.
